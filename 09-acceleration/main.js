/*
  acceleration
    - a change of velocity over time 
    - has a magnitude (velocity) and direction (angle)
    - both velocity (speed) and direction (angle) can change over time
    - can be represented by a vector
    - velocity per unit of time or (dist per time unit) per time unit

  Gravity
    - a type of acceleration, roughly (32 feet per second) per second
      or 32ft/secÂ²
    e.g. a dropped object will have an accleration of 
        32fps->64fps->96fps,...

  Acceleration implies some 'force' is acting on the velocity of an object
  causing it to change direction; if no force is acting on the object
  it will maintain both its speed and its direction

  Euler Method
    - method of adding acceleration to velocity and velocity to position
      on each time step
    - it's a 'mathematical integration'
    - the greater the time step, the less accurate the method, other 
      methods are more accurate but Euler's method is generally fine
      for games
